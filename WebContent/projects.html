					<h2 id="sectionTitle">SCheduler</h2>
					<h3 id="subsection">BACKGROUND</h3>
					<p>As a part of my Principles of Software Development course, I had the opportunity to collaborate 
					with other students in developing a web-based Java program of our choice. For our project, we 
					created SCheduler. SCheduler is a tool USC students can use to streamline the ever-difficult class 
					registration process.</p>
					<h3 id="subsection">TECHNICAL DETAILS</h3>
					<p>Using the major and the classes a student has already taken as input, the SCheduler utilizes an 
					algorithm we designed to generate five different course plans, each mapping out a unique arrangement 
					of the courses the student must take that will fulfill their specific graduation requirements. The 
					student can also save their favorite course plan to reaccess it in future visits to the webpage or 
					regenerate five more schedules if they are unhappy with the first five. <br /><br />
					We utilized MySQL for the functionality of saving the selected course plans to the database, as well 
					as to store course information and major requirements. All of the back-end code was written in Java,
					while the entirety of the front-end was written using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We also used the 
					Materialize CSS Framework to beautify the website. </p>
					<h3 id="subsection">CONCLUSION</h3>
					<p>Working with a group of other students was definitely an unfamiliar challenge at first, but it was 
					a great experience working with my other bright colleagues and working through our issues as a team to 
					achieve our common goal. It was also an incredibly valuable experience to collaborate with other 
					students to create the entire documentation for this project. The SCheduler is no longer publicly 
					available online.</p>

					<h2 id="sectionTitle">BlackJack!</h2>
					<h3 id="subsection">BACKGROUND</h3>
					<p>BlackJack! is a standalone Java application I developed that allows 1-3 users connected on the same server 
					to play a modified version of the classic card game, BlackJack. It was a great chance to gain experience in 
					implementing server sockets to allow different clients on the same network to partake in the same game. 
					Currently, BlackJack! <b>does not</b> have a user-friendly GUI and is displayed in the console. I hope to make time 
					in the future to create a GUI for BlackJack! as another project!</p>
					<h3 id="subsection">TECHNICAL DETAILS</h3>
					<p>To play BlackJack!, the user initially starts a server by inputting an available port on which the program 
					will instantiate a server socket. Once created, clients can connect to the server and create games with unique 
					room names, ranging in size from 1 - 3 players. <br /><br />
					When the room reaches capacity, the players are prompted in turns to make bets. Each player starts with 
					500 coins and the game ends when one player loses all their coins. Once bets have been placed by all players, 
					all players and the dealer are dealt 2 random cards each. Players then take turns deciding either to stay or 
					hit, adding another random card to their hand and being prompted once again if choosing the latter. <br /><br />
					Once each player has decided to either stay or busts and loses the turn, the automated dealer takes its turn. 
					To implement the dealer's logic, I created an algorithm in which the dealer will hit until his hand value is 
					greater than or equal to 17. This simplified the decision logic and made it easier for players to beat the 
					dealer. When the dealer's turn is over, the round ends, and players are either awarded or deducted their bet 
					amounts, depending on whether their hand beat the dealers.</p>
					<h3 id="subsection">CONCLUSION</h3>
					<p>Creating the BlackJack! program turned out to be much harder than I had originally expected it to be. It 
					was an interesting experience working with server sockets and adding network functionality so that different 
					clients could communicate with each other when connected on the same server. Working on this project with 
					networked programming was a greatly educational and informative encounter and I look forward to working with 
					networked programming further in the future!</p>

					<h2 id="sectionTitle">Personal Website</h2>
					<h3 id="subsection">BACKGROUND</h3>
					<p>As a way to pass the time throughout my winter break, and also as a way for me to practice my 
					front-end web development skills, I coded my personal website, the website that you're currently 
					viewing!</p>
					<h3 id="subsection">TECHNICAL DETAILS</h3>
					<p>For the development of this site, in addition to writing my own HTML 5 and CSS 3, I also utilized the 
					stunning Materialize front-end framework to help with the design and special plug-ins on some of the pages. 
					In addition, I created my own private server using DigitalOcean to host my website. It was a great chance 
					for me to practice my front-end design skills and to expand my knowledge of a framework that I've had a bit 
					of experience with.</p>
					<h3 id="subsection">CONCLUSION</h3>
					<p>The development of this site took me about a month, and it is still being updated constantly. I will be 
					working on a completely rebuilding the site in regards to design, but in the meantime, feel free to let me 
					know what you think about my website!</p>
